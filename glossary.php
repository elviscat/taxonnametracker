In the phylogenetic system, only species can be ancestral taxa. Groups of species are specifically excluded from being ancestral to other groups of species or to single species. The biological rationale for this distinction is clear; there is an array of processes termed speciation that allow for one species to give rise to another (or two species to give rise to a species of hybrid origin), but there are no known processes that allow for a genus or a family to give rise to other taxa that contain two or more species (&quot;genusation&quot; and &quot;familization&quot; are biologically unknown). <u>Thus, each monophyletic group begins as a single species</u>. <u>This species is the ancestor of all subsequent members of the monophyletic group</u>.</font></p>

There two kinds of artificial groups, paraphyletic and polyphyletic groups. Paraphyletic groups are artificial because one or more descendants of an ancestor are excluded from the group. Examples include Vermes and Reptilia. Polyphyletic groups are artificial because the common ancestor is placed in another taxon. Examples include Homeothermia. &quot;Ancestor&quot; is used in its logical sense, i.e., the ancestor is unknown but its inclusion or exclusion can be deduced as a logical consequence of the grouping. The important contrast is between monophyletic groups and nonmonophyletic groups. Paraphyletic groups are as artificial as polyphyletic groups. Further, it is not always possible to distinguish clearly the status of a group as either paraphyletic or polyphyletic.</font></p>

The relative hierarchical position of a taxon in a classification can be indicated in many ways. In the Linnaean system, relative rank is denoted by the use of categories. Do not confuse the rank of a taxon with its reality as a group. Aves is a taxon that includes exactly the same organisms whether it is ranked as a class, an order, or a family.</font></p>

Trees may be rooted or unrooted and are composed of several parts. Branches are lines connecting branch points to terminal taxan. The branching point in a tree, or node, illustrates a speciation event. This exists for all natural taxa; taxa joined by branch points can be higher taxa (supraspecific taxa) such as families or phyla (remember higher taxa always originate as species). Internodes are lines between two speciation events and they always represent an ancestral species. More than once species may be represented if one finds a new species or group of species that belongs to this part of the phylogeny but was excluded from the phylogeny. The basal-most internode is the root. The term interval is often used for internode.</font></p>
