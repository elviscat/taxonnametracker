    <em>Taxon Name Tracker </em>is a  community resource offered to provide research and educational opportunities as  to the function of our biological classifications of biological diversity, how  these classifications are determined and developed, the rules underlying the  formation of scientific names and classifications, and a transparent forum for  researchers to announce and comment on new species descriptions, new  phylogenetic studies, and recent published recommended changes to a  classification.<br>
    Public  announcements of new evidence-based research and opinions regarding new species  and changes in nomenclature and biological classifications provides a  transparent arena for scientists to discuss and debate issues, if necessary,  and for others with a more limited understanding of the systematic and  taxonomic processes foundational to biological classifications to learn more  about the process by raising questions and following discussions.<br>
    <br>
    <em>Taxon Name Tracker</em> also  maintains a complete classification of the fishes of the Order Cypriniformes  and will eventually provide annotations for species as to the evidence, or lack  thereof, for our current classification of these fishes.
    Users are strongly encouraged use our  blogging capabilities to post new information on any taxonomic issues relating  to Cypriniformes fishes as well as raise comment on postings, raise questions  and provide opinions on taxa.
    All  postings are linked to one or more taxa to which the content applies, except in  cases where you report new species, new papers, and new findings relevant to  the taxonomy and classification of Cypriniformes fishes.
    Thus, users need to identify taxa in the  classification in advance of posting information.
    A full history of discussions is archived and  all evidenced based research recommending changes in the taxonomy are open for  public comment for six months.
    We also  provide a glossary of terms most frequently used in discussions, a resource  that will grow with time, and a link to the International Code of Zoological  Nomenclature.  We welcome your  participation in this research and educational effort, as well as feedback as  to how to make this resource more useful and user friendly.<br>
    <br>
    Please  register and complete the short survey that helps us learn more about your  level of expertise with fishes, systematics, taxonomy, and biological  classifications.  Only registered users  can provide posts and comments.</p>
