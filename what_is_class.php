This is the practice of generating
arrangments of biological nomenclature in a hierarchical fashion. In
a sense, it can represent a product of the combination of the fields
of taxonomy and systematics produced in a hierarchical pattern that
represents some kind of relationship. Biological classifications are
generally thought of as hierarchical classifications because the
process of evolution/speciation produces a hierarchical set of
genealogical relationships that can be depicted in a hierarchical
classification.
